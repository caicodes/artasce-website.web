# colormode

> PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST TIME CONSUMING SETUPS IN VARIOUS FRAMEWORKS

I have a drop in vuetify toggle, it's not syncing yet with anything like localstorage, etc.. I'll do this with nuxt, but maybe not with the vite/vue just yet.. If I do, pinia may be involved, for now, nuxt, easy and light/dark only for this starter!

Done... sync later, I'm not in the mood for another battle with color modes and theming, besides, I've pretty much nailed a few different setups, now it's about the vuetify elements, the starter site, the presentation/navigation/buttery effects for show!
