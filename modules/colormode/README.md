# colormode module

started from this repo... the `starter-nuxt-deluxe` official...

## note, exporting as is

gonna export this module as is, jump in on a new nuxt project, add the colormode module and tweak several of the others, the suite is growing, this site will add firebase and a nuxt-content module... the modules idea is greatly benefitting dev time and minimal frustration... the suite will grow and improve and getting a versioning plan and master repo will be helpful...
